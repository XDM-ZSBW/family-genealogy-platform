## Current Issue

**The marketing page has been uploaded to the FTP server but is not being served by the web server.**

### Evidence:
1. **FTP Directory Listing:** Shows `index.html` (21,388 bytes) in root
2. **Web Response:** Still serving default Porkbun page (607 bytes)
3. **Test File:** Uploaded `test.html` returns 404 Not Found
4. **Server:** Running LiteSpeed Web Server with PHP

### Likely Causes:
1. **Different Document Root:** The FTP root may not be the web document root
2. **Server Configuration:** Web server may be configured to serve from a subdirectory (e.g., `public_html`, `htdocs`, `www`)
3. **Index Priority:** Server may prioritize `index.php` over `index.html`
4. **Caching:** Server-side caching may be preventing updates

## Next Steps (Manual Intervention Required)

### Option 1: Contact Porkbun Support
- Ask about the correct document root for `futurelink.zip`
- Request information about web server configuration
- Confirm if uploads should go to a subdirectory

### Option 2: Try Alternative Upload Paths
The following paths should be tested via FTP:
- `/public_html/index.html`
- `/htdocs/index.html` 
- `/www/index.html`
- `/domains/futurelink.zip/public_html/index.html`

### Option 3: Check Control Panel
- Log into Porkbun control panel
- Look for file manager or hosting configuration
- Verify document root settings
